# MITM-attack-on-6LowPAN-Wireless-Sensor-Network

In this project a Man In The Middle attack in a Low Power IoT sensor network in a testbed scenario is performed. To create the wireless sensor network, a 6LoWPAN Border Router is established with Raspberry Pi 4 and TI-cc2650 launchpad. A TI-cc2650stk sensor tag is used for sensor data reading. The MITM attack is performed on the border router and by performing ARP spoofing at the TCP/IP network. The sensor data is successfully altered in such an attack.


##To understand, create and experitment the project by realizing it in the testbed go through the files in the Documentation.
